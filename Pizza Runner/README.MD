## 🍕 Pizza Runner — SQL Case Study

This repository contains my solutions for the Pizza Runner case study from the 8 Week SQL Challenge. The project focuses on cleaning messy data, analyzing customer orders, and evaluating runner performance using SQL.



## 📚 What I practiced

In this solution file, I worked on:

- Cleaning and transforming raw data using SQL

- Handling NULL values and text inconsistencies

- Performing JOIN operations across multiple tables

- Using aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG

- Applying GROUP BY and ORDER BY for analysis

- Working with date and time calculations

- Implementing CASE statements for business logic

- Solving real-world operational and delivery analytics problems

## 🗂️ Dataset

The analysis is based on the following tables:

- customer_orders — pizza orders placed by customers

- runner_orders — delivery details handled by runners

- pizza_names — pizza ID and name mapping

- pizza_recipes — toppings used for each pizza

- pizza_toppings — topping ID and topping names

## 📊 Business questions solved

The SQL queries answer key business questions such as:

- Total pizzas ordered and delivered

- Successful delivery percentage

- Runner performance and delivery time analysis

- Customer ordering patterns

- Most popular pizzas and toppings

- Order modifications (exclusions and extras)

- Distance and duration analysis for deliveries

- Revenue calculation and delivery insights

## 🎯 Learning outcome

This case study improved my ability to clean messy datasets, perform analytical SQL queries, and extract meaningful operational insights from delivery and order data.
