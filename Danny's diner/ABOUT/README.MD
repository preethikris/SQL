## 📚 What I practiced

In this solution file, I worked on:

Writing basic to intermediate SQL queries

Performing INNER JOINs across multiple tables

Using aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, and AVG

Applying GROUP BY and ORDER BY for summarization

Working with date filtering and calculations

Implementing CASE statements for business logic

Solving real-world analytical questions using SQL

## 🗂️ Dataset

The analysis is based on three tables:

sales — customer orders with order dates and product IDs

menu — product names and prices

members — customer loyalty program join dates

## 📊 Business questions solved

- The SQL queries answer key business problems, including:

- Total amount spent by each customer

- Number of visit days per customer

- Most purchased item overall

- First item purchased by each customer

- Most popular item per customer

- Items purchased before becoming a member

- Loyalty points earned by customers

- Spending behavior before and after membership

## 🎯 Learning outcome

This case study helped me strengthen my SQL and data analysis skills by translating business questions into queries and generating meaningful insights from relational data.
