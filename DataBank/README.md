## 📚 What I practiced

In this solution file, I worked on:

- Writing analytical SQL queries on banking transaction data

- Performing JOIN operations across multiple tables

- Using aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, and AVG

- Applying GROUP BY and ORDER BY for summarization

- Working with date calculations and time-based analysis

- Implementing CASE statements for transaction classification

- Using window functions for running balances and trends

- Solving real-world financial analytics problems

## 🗂️ Dataset

The analysis is based on the following tables:

- regions — region information

- customer_nodes — node allocation history for customers

- customer_transactions — deposits, withdrawals, and purchases

## 📊 Business questions solved

The SQL queries answer key business questions such as:

- Number of customers allocated to each region

- Node reallocation patterns

- Transaction type distribution

- Total deposits and withdrawals

- Average transaction amount per customer

- Running balance calculations

- Monthly transaction trends

- Customer financial behavior insights

## 🎯 Learning outcome

This case study improved my ability to analyze financial transaction data, track customer allocation changes, and generate insights using advanced SQL techniques.
