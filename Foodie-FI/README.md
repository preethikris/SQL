## 📚 What I practiced

In this solution file, I worked on:

- Writing analytical SQL queries on subscription data

- Performing JOIN operations across tables

- Using aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG

- Applying GROUP BY and ORDER BY for summarization

- Working with date calculations and time-based analysis

- Implementing CASE statements for subscription status logic

- Using window functions for tracking plan changes

- Solving real-world SaaS subscription analytics problems

## 🗂️ Dataset

The analysis is based on two main tables:

- subscriptions — customer plan history with start dates

## 📊 Business questions solved

The SQL queries answer key business questions such as:

- Total number of customers

- Monthly customer growth trends

- Plan distribution after trial period

- Customer churn analysis

- Upgrade and downgrade patterns

- Average time taken to upgrade plans

- Conversion rate from trial to paid plans

- Revenue estimation based on subscriptions

## 🎯 Learning outcome

This case study improved my ability to analyze subscription lifecycle data, understand customer retention metrics, and generate business insights using SQL.
